# ECE355-PWM-Monitor

<h2> Project Description: 
The purpose of this project is to create an embedded system for monitoring and controlling a PWM
signal generated by a 555 timer(NE555 IC).This project uses an STMF32f0 microcontroller board to
drives an external 4N35 optocoupler which controls the PWM signal by adjusting the resistance on
voltage divider, this frequency as well as the resistance are then display on the emulation LCD screen
which uses Hitachi HD44780 LCD as its base. A potentiometer (POT) on the Emulation board is
connected to an analog to digital converter (ADC) on the microcontroller, this digital value is then used
by the 8-bit parallel interface to be display on the LCD screen. The DAC then uses the digital value of the
voltage(0-5V) and send that signal to the 4N35 optocoupler to the NE555 timer to control the PWM
signal. The frequency of this signal is then read by the microcontroller using a timer interrupt display on
an LCD through the 8-bit parallel interface.
  
<h2> Project Requirement: 
* Implement a frequency counter.
* Implment an ADC to convert the value on the potionmeter.
* Implement an DAC to convert the digital value of the potionmeter to be used by the optocoupler. 
* Implement an LCD screen to display frequency and resistence.
